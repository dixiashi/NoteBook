### Avoid the build errors caused due to old / cached version of pacages:
Whenever any nuget package gets republished to Nexus without change of version number, we should use following way to get the latest changes:

> 1. Navigate to packages folder present in your solution    
> 2. Delete packages folder    
> 3. Open your code in VS    
> 4. In Package Manager Console, type the command nuget restore -nocache    

This command will ensure that your solution  pulls the latest version of package from source rather than pulling from any of the caches (http / global nuget)
