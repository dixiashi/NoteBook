* '\n' or '0x0A' (10 in decimal) -> This character is called "Line Feed" (LF).
* '\r' or '0x0D' (13 in decimal) -> This one is called "Carriage return" (CR).

They expect a newline to be the combination of two characters, namely '\r\n' (or 13 followed by 10).

Unix uses a single '\n' to indicate a new line.

* Mac​
Macs use a single '\r'.
