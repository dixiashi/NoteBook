## Quick Tips to Configure IIS in the FMO server that replicate all configurations and setting in CMO 

### Targeted Audience: individuals who needs to configure IIS. 

There are chances we miss some of the configurations while configuring FMO server, usually on complex applications. To avoid that, there is a simple way to replicate the IIS setup from CMO to FMO.

This helped us improving the iDeploy application speed in FMO.


If application is hosted in IIS, the best practice to set up the application in new version of IIS is to use web deploy method.

Steps:

1.	Download Webdeploy_amd64_en-us.msi from https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/web-deploy
2.	Install the msi in both CMO and FMO server.
3.	Execute the below commands in the CMO server from command prompt:    
    1. %windir%\System32\inetsrv\appcmd add backup “BackupFolderName"
    1. cd Program files\iis\microsoft web deploy v3\
    1. msdeploy -verb:sync -source:metakey=lm/w3svc/1 -dest:package=c:\<FileName>.zip > logfile.log
    > This will create a Zip file with Filename mentioned in the highlighted place under C:\. Copy the file to new server and paste it at C:\
4.	Then execute the below commands in command prompt in the FMO server.
    1. cd Program files\iis\microsoft web deploy v3\
    1. Msdeploy –verb:sync –source:package=C:\ <FileName>.zip –dest:metakey=lm/w3svc/1 > logfile.log
    > This will replicate the IIS from old server to new server copying the configuration same to same.
